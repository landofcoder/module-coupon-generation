Hi, {{var customer_name|raw}},

Sorry for bothering you. We are now testing our coupon code generation tool and are happy to have all the customer feedback we can get.
Please come back to us if any questions.

By the way, to compensate your time we would like to offer a {{var discount_amount_formatted|raw}} discount on any products at the store. Don't hesitate to use it!

Best Regard!
Your coupon code is {{var coupon_code|raw}}.
The coupon will give you {{var discount_amount_formatted|raw}} discount.
